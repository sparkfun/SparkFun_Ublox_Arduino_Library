  basically do whatever you want with this code.

  This example shows how to change the Ublox module's dynamic platform model and then
  query its lat/long/altitude. We also turn off the NMEA output on the I2C port.
  This decreases the amount of I2C traffic dramatically.

  Possible values for the dynamic model are: PORTABLE, STATIONARY, PEDESTRIAN, AUTOMOTIVE,
  SEA, AIRBORNE1g, AIRBORNE2g, AIRBORNE4g, WRIST, BIKE

  Note: Long/lat are large numbers because they are * 10^7. To convert lat/long
  to something google maps understands simply divide the numbers by 10,000,000. We 
  do this so that we don't have to use floating point numbers.

  Leave NMEA parsing behind. Now you can simply ask the module for the datums you want!

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the GPS and a BlackBoard
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
